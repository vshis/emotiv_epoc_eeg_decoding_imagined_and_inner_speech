With CyKit-master unzipped to C:\, use CyKit.ps1 as a helper script to connect to the Emotiv Epoc+.

* Change 'Driver' to "Generic Raw Telnet Reader"
* In 'Preferences', ensure that drift correction is disabled,
otherwise you risk introducing synthetic signal.
* In 'Driver Properties':
	* input the correct number of channels
	* input the correct sampling frequency
	* change 'Telnet host name' to 5151
	* change 'Endianness' to "Big endian"
	* change 'Sample type' to "32 bits float"
	* change 'Skip footer (bytes)' to "0"
	* change channel names as required
